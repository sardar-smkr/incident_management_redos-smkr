It aligns with ITIL best practices and establishes consistent workflows for incident detection, classification, escalation, resolution, and post-incident analysis.\n\n**At the beginning, acquire the user information by following SOP 8.1. As a result, this ID can be used to identify the user and populate the fields that reference the current user of the system.**\n\n# **Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)**\n\n## **1. Client Management Operations**\n\n### 1.1 Creating Client Records\n\n**When to use:** When registering new enterprise, mid-market, small business, or startup clients who will require access to incident management services in the ticketing system.\n\n**Who can perform:**\n\n* Account Managers  \n* System Administrators  \n* Technical Support\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Verify the user has authorization to conduct this action using check_authorization.  \n2.

Create a new incident using manage_incidents.  \n5. If the severity is P1 or P2, then a new incident bridge is initiated by following SOP 4.5  \n6. If affected configuration item(s) information were provided, then for each configuration item:  \n   * Create incident-CI relationship by following SOP 4.13  \n7. Log the incident creation action using log_audit_records.  \n   \n\n**Halt, and use transfer_to_human if you receive the following errors; otherwise complete the SOP:**\n\n* Missing or invalid inputs  \n* Assigned user not found or inactive, if provided  \n* Configuration item not found or inactive  \n* Problem ticket not found or closed, if provided  \n* Invalid category value  \n* Invalid severity, impact or urgency value  \n* Invalid status value  \n* Incident record creation failed\n\n  ---\n\n### 4.2 Updating Incident Status\n\n**When to use:** When incident status changes are required during the incident lifecycle.\n\n**Who can perform:**\n\n* Incident Managers  \n* Technical Support assigned to the incident  \n* System Administrators  \n* Executive\n\n**Steps:**\n\n1.

Log the incident resolution action using `log_audit_records`.\n\n**Halt, and use `transfer_to_human` if you receive the following errors; otherwise complete the SOP:**\n\n* Approval missing to resolve incident  \n* Incident not found or invalid status  \n* Missing required postmortem information  \n* Invalid report_status value  \n* Report generation failed  \n* Incident resolution update failed  \n* Audit trail logging failure  \n  ---\n\n### 4.5 Initiating an Incident Bridge\n\n**When to use:** When an active incident requires immediate, multi-team collaboration to coordinate diagnostic, communication, and recovery actions.\n\nA bridge must be initiated for all P1 (Critical) and P2 (High) incidents.\n\nFor P3 or P4 incidents, bridge initiation requires prior Incident Manager approval before proceeding.\n\n**Who can perform:**\n\n* Incident Managers  \n* Technical Support Specialists  \n* Executives\n\n**Steps:**\n\n1. Obtain the following required information:  \n   * **incident_id**: Incident requiring bridge collaboration. Acquire by following SOP 8.1 (Acquiring Entity Records and IDs)  \n2. Validate that incident is in an `open` or `in_progress` state and has an assigned Incident Manager.  \n3. Verify the user has authorization to conduct this action using `check_authorization`.  \n4. If the user is not authorized, then check If severity is P3 or P4. If that is the case, then obtain approval from the Incident Manager using `manage_approval_requests` and stop proceeding with the SOP.  \n5. Extract the Incident Manager assigned to the incident from Step 1.  \n6. Create the bridge record with the following values using `manage_coordinations`\n\n   * **Bridge Type**: `major_incident`, `coordination`, or `technical`  \n   * **Bridge Host**: Incident Manager assigned to the incident  \n   * **Start Time**: System-generated current timestamp  \n   * **Status**: `active`  \n7. For P1 and P2 incidents, the bridge type is going to be \u2018major_incident\u2019  \n8. Update the incident status to `in_progress` if its status is `open` using `manage_incidents`.  \n9. Log the bridge initiation action using `log_audit_records`.\n\n**Halt, and use `transfer_to_human` if you receive the following problems; otherwise complete the SOP:**\n\n* Incident not found or invalid status  \n* Incident missing assigned Incident Manager  \n* Approval missing for P3/P4 incident bridge initiation  \n* Impacted client or configuration item fields not populated  \n* Bridge host user not found or inactive  \n* Bridge record creation failed  \n* Incident update failed  \n* Invalid bridge status value  \n* Audit trail logging failure  \n  ---\n\n### 4.6 Closing an Incident Bridge\n\n**When to use:** When the incident has reached a confirmed resolution or stable workaround and real-time collaboration is no longer required.\n\n**Who can perform:**\n\n* Incident Managers  \n* Technical Support Specialists (if delegated by Incident Manager)\n\n**Steps:**\n\n1. Verify the user has authorization to conduct this action using `check_authorization`.\n\n2. Obtain the following required information:\n\n   * **incident_id**: Incident associated with the bridge to close. Acquire by following SOP 8.1 (Acquiring Entity Records and IDs)  \n   * **bridge_id**: Bridge to close. Acquire by following SOP 8.1 (Acquiring Entity Records and IDs)  \n3. Validate the bridge status is `active`.  \n4. Validate the bridge host user is found and active using `discover_parties`.  \n5. Update the bridge status to `closed` using `manage_coordinations`.\n\n6. Update the bridge end time to current timestamp using `manage_coordinations`.\n\n7. Log the bridge closure action using `log_audit_records`.\n\n**Halt, and use `transfer_to_human` if you receive the following problems; otherwise complete the SOP:**\n\n* User not authorized to close bridges  \n* Incident not found  \n* Bridge record not found or not linked to incident  \n* Bridge status is not `active`  \n* Bridge host user not found or inactive  \n* Incident status is not `resolved` or `monitoring`  \n* Incident missing required resolution documentation or impact summary  \n* Bridge status update failed  \n* Bridge end time update failed  \n* Audit trail logging failure  \n  ---\n\n### 4.7 Requesting Approvals\n\n**When to use:** When an action requires documented authorization before execution.
